1,Routine,Water-fill hoses,"Over time, the water hoses that came with your new washing machine may leak or burst. It's a good preventive maintenance practice to check these hoses from time to time for any sign of wear or weakness. Often there's a small blister in the rubber of the hose, which could rupture. Most manufacturers recommend replacing the hoses every 5 years.",Repair Clinic,http://www.repairclinic.com/Washing-Machine-Maintenance-Tips
2,Routine,Leveling,"Because your washing machine is so heavy, when it's not level, it can vibrate strongly during the spin cycle. If your washing machine is not perfectly level--with all four legs touching the floor--it can bang and rock back and forth, and even begin to \"walk\" across the room. This isn't good for the machine and may damage anything near the machine.;Your washing machine has adjustable, front leveling legs with a lock nut. You adjust the leg to the proper height, then tighten the lock nut up against the body of the machine to keep the leg from rotating.;Some machines have adjustable leveling legs in the rear also, and you can adjust them in the same way. Keep the machine as close to the floor as possible--the lower it is, the less likely it is to vibrate.;Most machines, however, have \"self-adjusting\" rear legs. You set these legs by tilting the entire machine forward onto its front legs (with the rear legs 3 to 4 inches off the floor) and then setting the machine back down. The legs should adjust automatically. If they don't, you may need to tilt the machine forward and rap on the rear legs with the handle of a hammer to loosen them--a procedure that's easier to accomplish with a helper.",Repair Clinic,http://www.repairclinic.com/Washing-Machine-Maintenance-Tips
3,Routine,Surface Cleaning,"Your washer has either a painted steel or porcelain-coated steel cabinet. It's perfectly safe to use a little dish detergent and a damp rag to clean all of its surfaces. If the surface is porcelain, you can even use a little non-abrasive cleanser for stubborn stains.",Repair Clinic,http://www.repairclinic.com/Washing-Machine-Maintenance-Tips
4,Routine,Lint disposal,"Most washing machines collect lint during the wash cycle and send it down the drain during the drain cycle. If your machine is a Maytag, though, it may be different. Most Maytag washing machines collect lint in the center tube of the agitator. You need to lift out that tube and clean it periodically. Other machines have a lint filter near the top of the tub, which you need to slide out, clean off, and reinsert.",Repair Clinic,http://www.repairclinic.com/Washing-Machine-Maintenance-Tips
5,Problem,Clothing covered with lint or pet hair,"After washing pet bedding or extremely dirty items, clean washe completely before washing next load of laundry.;If clothing is heavily covered with hair, heavy sand or lint, add an extra rinse to the wash cycle.;Use less detergent to reduce suds that can redeposit soil and lint on clothing.;Do not overload washer.

The clothes must be loaded correctly in loose heaps so that the water and detergent can reach every surface.;Adding detergent improperly can reduce effectiveness. If you have a top-loading machine, the detergent and any additives should be added to the washer tub before clothes are loaded. Pouring the detergent on the top of the load reduces its effectiveness because some clothes get too much product and others get very little.;Washers with automatic dispensers for detergents can become clogged. If clogged, not enough detergent will reach the clothes and reduce effectiveness.;If you use too much detergent, the suds can keep the washer from working correctly. The additional suds do not rinse out well and actually redeposit soil onto clothes.;There are different cycle settings on your washer for a reason. Heavily soiled clothing needs more time in the detergent solution to achieve cleanliness. It is also important to select the correct water temperature for the type of laundry and the type of detergent.",About.com,http://laundry.about.com/od/washermaintenancerepair/a/My-Washer-Is-Ruining-My-Clothes.htm

Check all pockets, zip zippers and snap or hook fasteners before loading garments into the washer. Snags or holes can also be caused by a rough spot along the washer tub wall. Use a flashlight to check the washer drum for chipped finishes and repair promptly.;Rust Spots on Clothes: If rust spots appear on your clothes, there is probably a chip in the washer basket. The exposed metal will rust and stain your clothing. Again, use a flashlight to carefully inspect every inch. When you find the chip, use special washer drum repair paint to correct the chip. Check the outside of your washer and dryer to be sure that rust is not getting on your clothes as you load and unload them. Follow these tips to remove the rust stains.;Black Spots on Clothes: The black spots could be mildew if you have allowed clothing to sit in the washer too long. Always remove wet clothes promptly.

Allow the washer to run through its longest wash and spin cycle. Immediately fill the washer with hot water again and add 1 quart distilled white vinegar . Run the longest wash and spin cycle again.;Using the bleach and vinegar will clean away bacteria, soap scum and mineral deposits from the wash basket and hoses.

18,How To,Clean Those Dispensers,"Newer machines have handy built-in dispensers for detergent, fabric softener and bleach. These, too, need to be cleaned regularly.;Each dispenser should be cleaned every month to six weeks to keep them working well. You certainly don't want them dumping too much product in your wash load or failing to empty at the correct time.

Warm 1 cup of white vinegar in the microwave or in a small saucepan. Pour it into the dispenser and allow it to sit for a few minutes to loosen any build up. Run the machine following a normal cycle.
